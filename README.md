# first_r_package
Zero percent useful except that now I know the basics of building an R package and adding documentation to it. 

# Dependencies:
* devtools
* roxygen2

# Thank you 
to [this blog post](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) by [Hilary Parker](https://twitter.com/hspter?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for making what seems difficult so simple and accessible. 

Next up: a useful R package?
